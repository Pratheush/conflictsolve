What if you're given a chance to restart your life and make new choices again? One day, 
Lawyer Jae Sang opens his eyes and realizes that he is no longer in the world he used 
to live in but in a parallel world. He sheds his old life where he had been willing to 
do anything for his interests and turned into a whole different person, a righteous and 
sincere lawyer. People all make mistakes and wrong choices and regret what they did in 
the past all the time. However, the present moment is the only time over which we have 
dominion. We can always make the right choice to straighten things up whenever we realize 
that we're on the wrong path. Lawyer Jae Sang sends us a message that it's never too late 
to correct our wrongdoings and start afresh and encourages us to express our honest feelings 
to those around us throughout the series.
